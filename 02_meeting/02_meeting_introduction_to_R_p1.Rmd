## Assignment operator
The symbol `<-` assign value to a symbol.


```{r}
x <- 10 
print(x)

txt <- "Hello World!"
txt
```

The # character indicates a comment. Anything to the right of the # (including the # itself) is ignored. This is the only comment character in R. 

<span style="color:red">**Exercise 1:**</span> What happen if you run the following code in your R script?
```
x <- # This expression is incomplete
```
```{r}
x <- 101 # nothing printed
x      # auto-printing occurs

print(x) # explicit printing
```

The `[1]` in the output indicates that `x` is a vector and `101` is its first element.

```{r}
y <- 3:17
y
```

The numbers in the `[]` are not part of the vector itself.

The operator `:` is used to create a interger sequence. 

<span style="color:red">**Exercise 2:**</span> In your Exercise R script, create a sequence of integer from 2000 to 2010.

## R Objects

### Data types

R has 5 basic atomic classes

* logical (e.g., TRUE, FALSE)
* integer (e.g,, 5L, as.integer(2))
* numeric (real or decimal) (e.g, 3, 4.5, pi)
* complex (e.g, 1 + 0i, 1 + 4i)
* character (e.g, "a", "hi")

To explicity declare an integer, you need specify the `L` suffix.

A special number is `Inf` which represents infinity. You can use `Inf` in ordinary calculations; e.g. `1 / Inf` is 0.

### Data structures
R also has many data structures. These include

* vector
* matrix
* list
* factors
* data frame

####  Vector
It is the most common and basic data structure.
*Empty vector*: You can create a vector pre-defining the length and/or type.

```{r}
x0 <- vector() # empty vector

x1 <- vector(length = 10) # with a pre-defined length

## with a length and type
x2 <- vector("character", length = 10)
x3 <- vector("numeric", length = 10)
x4 <- vector("integer", length = 10)
x5 <- vector("logical", length = 10)
```
You can examine your vector using 
```
typeof(x)
length(x)
class(x)
str(x)
```
<span style="color:red">**Exercise 3:**</span> In your Exercise R script, print and examine the vectors `x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5`.

You can also create vectors using the `c()` function.

```{r}
num_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5) # numeric vector
num_vec
```

To explicitly create a vector of integers:
```{r}
int_vec <- c(1L,2L,3L,4L,5L) # vector of integers
int_vec
```

To create a logical vector:
```{r}
logical_vec <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) # logical vector
logical_vec
```

To create character vector:
```{r}
char_vec <- c("apple", "pear", "banana","grape") # character vector
char_vec
```

You can also add elements to your vector.
```{r}
int_vec <- c(int_vec,6L)
int_vec
```

<span style="color:red">**Exercise 4:**</span> In your Exercise R script, add two more fruits to the `char_vec`.

**Attention** Vectors have only one type, if you add more than on type to your vector, R will create a vector that is the least common denominator following the coersion rule`logical < integer < numeric < complex < character`.


<span style="color:red">**Exercise 5:**</span> In your Exercise R script, without running the code, guess what is the vector result.
```
x <- c(10.1, "b")
x <- c(TRUE, 33)
x <- c("city", TRUE)
```

Objects can be explicitly coerced using `as.<class_name>`

```{r}
x <- 1:5
as.numeric(x)
as.logical(x)
as.character(x)
as.complex(x)

```
####  Matrix
Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute.
```{r}
m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
m
dim(m)
attributes(m)
```
Matrices are constructed column-wise, so entries can be thought of starting in the "upper left" corner and running down the columns.
```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
m
```
Matrices can also be created directly from vectors by adding a dimension attribute.
```{r}
m <- 1:10 
m
```
```{r}
dim(m) <- c(2, 5)
m
```

Matrices can be created by column-binding or row-binding with the `cbind()` and `rbind()` functions.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- 10:12
z_column <- cbind(x, y)
z_row <- rbind(x, y) 
```

####  List
List is a special type of vector that can contain elements of different classes.

Lists can be explicitly created using the `list()` or coerce other objects using `as.list()` function.

```{r}
x <- list(3:7, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
x
```
```{r}
x <- 3:10
x <- as.list(x)
length(x)
```
<span style="color:red">**Exercise 6:**</span> In your Exercise R script, run the code above. What is the class of `x[1]`? how about `x[[1]]`?

####  Factors 
Factors are used to represent categorical data and can be unordered or ordered. 

Factor objects can be created with the `factor()`   function.
```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no")) 
x
```

```{r}
table(x) 
x
```
```{r}
unclass(x)  
attr(x,"levels")
```

The order of the levels of a factor can be set using the `levels` argument to `factor()`. 

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
x  ## Levels are put in alphabetical order
```
```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"), 
            levels = c("yes", "no"))
x
```

<span style="color:red">**Exercise 7:**</span> In your Exercise R script, order the fruits names bellow by their sizes.
```
"Apple","Blueberry","Grape","Grapefruit","Plum","Watermelon" 
```


####  Data frame

Data frames are used to store tabular data in R.
Hadley Wickham's package [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) has an optimized set of functions designed to work efficiently with data frames.

Caracteristics of a data frame:

* Each column of a data frame have the same length.
* Data frames have column names and to indicate information about each row of the data frame, we can use the atribute `row.names`
* Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column. 

A data frame can be created by reading in a dataset using the `read.table()` or `read.csv()`, be created explicitly with the `data.frame()` function, or they can be coerced from other types of objects like lists.

Data frames can be converted to a matrix by calling `data.matrix()`. 

```{r}
df <- data.frame(id = letters[1:10], x = 1:10, y = rnorm(10)) 
df
nrow(df)
ncol(df)
names(df)
names(df ) <- c("Identity","Position","Value")
names(df)
row.names(df) # show the row names
row.names(df) <- c("a1","a2","a3","a4","a5","a6","a7","a8","a9","a10") # assign row names to data frame
row.names(df) # show the row names

```


#### Missing Values

Missing values are denoted by `NA` or `NaN` for undefined mathematical operations.

* `is.na()` is used to test objects if they are `NA`

* `is.nan()` is used to test for `NaN`

`NA` values have a class also, so there are integer `NA`, character `NA`, etc.

* A `NaN` value is also `NA` but the converse is not true

```{r}
## Create a vector with NAs in it
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 10, 3)  
## Return a logical vector indicating which elements are NA
is.na(x)    

## Return a logical vector indicating which elements are NaN
is.nan(x)   

## Now create a vector with both NA and NaN values
x <- c(1, 2, NaN, NA, 4)
is.na(x)
is.nan(x)
```

<span style="color:red">**Exercise 8:**</span> In your Exercise R script:
1. Create the following data frame `df`. 
```{r , echo=FALSE}
ex8 <- data.frame(Var1 = letters[1:5], x = c(1.2,1.0,3.3,0.84,5), y = c("Apple","Apple","Orange","Banana","Coconut"),z = c("yes","yes","no","no","no"), k = round(rnorm(5,15),2)) 
knitr::kable(ex8)
```


2. Change the variable names (Var1, x, y, z, k) to (ID,Cost_unit,Fruit,Color_red,Price)

3. Order the `Fruit` levels as (Banana < Apple < Orange < Coconut) and `Color_red` levels as (no < yes)
