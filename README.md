# Women's Data Science Study Group - Calgary

This repository has all the files presented in women's data science study group.

In the past few years, I've been participating in several events related to Data Science/ Machine Learning/AI and I realized that only about 20% - 25% of the participants are women and lots of them feel a little isolated and even not inclusive. 
But I genuinely believe that women want to be part of this exciting field, but sometimes they don't have opportunities or encouragement.  
On February 23, 2019, I created this meetup to introduce and discuss topics related to Data Science to women in the field or not. 

The descriptions of each meeting are available at [Women's Data Science Study Group -Calgary](https://www.meetup.com/Womens-Data-Science-Study-Group-Calgary/).
