## Read and Writing Data
In R, there are many functions/packages to read all kinds of datasets. Some examples are:

* [`read.table`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.5.2/topics/read.table), `read.csv`, for reading tabular data
* [`readLines`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.3/topics/readLines), for reading lines of a text file

There are also many ways for wrinting data files

* [`write.table`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/KCsmart/versions/2.30.0/topics/write.table), for writing tabular data to text files (i.e. CSV) or connections
* [`writeLines`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.1/topics/writeLines), for writing character data line-by-line to a file or connection

CSV stands for Comma Separated Values.

### Reading Data files with `read.table`

For small to moderately sized datasets, you can usually call read.table without specifying any other arguments

Let's use `read.table()` to read the text file [Employee Sales](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/r-read-table-function/)

First, let's locate our current working Directory
```
getwd()
```
Now, let's display the list of files present in that directory
```{r}
list.files()
```
```{r}
employee_sales <- read.table("EmployeeSales.txt", header=TRUE, sep=",")
is.data.frame(employee_sales)
employee_sales
```
```{r}
ncol(employee_sales)
```
```{r}
nrow(employee_sales)
```
```{r}
dim(employee_sales)
```

In this case, R will automatically

* figure out how many rows there are (and how much memory needs to be allocated)
* figure what type of variable is in each column of the table.

Telling R all these things directly makes R run faster and more efficiently. The `read.csv()` function is identical to read.table except that some of the defaults are set differently (like the sep argument).

Reading the [Employees.csv](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/r-read-csv-function/) file using `read.csv()`. 
```{r}
employee <- read.csv("Employees.csv", TRUE, sep = ",")
employee
```

```{r}
str(employee)
```
Now that we know how to read table and csv files from the package `utils` (one of the several built in packages that comes when you install R), we will learn how to read them using much faster functions that are able to deal with larger flat files and quickly.

We will need to load the package `readr`
```{r}
library(readr)
```
The package `readr` supports seven file formats with seven `read_` functions:

* [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html): comma separated (CSV) files
* [`read_tsv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html): tab separated files
* [`read_delim()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html): general delimited files
* [`read_fwf()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_fwf.html): fixed width files
* [`read_table()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_table.html): tabular files where columns are separated by white-space.
* [`read_log()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_log.html): web log files


```{r}
employee_sales2 <- read_delim("EmployeeSales.txt", delim = ",")
employee_sales2
```

You also can read a csv file using `read_csv()`

```{r}
employee2 <- read_csv("Employees.csv", TRUE)
employee2
```

### Other types of data
To get other types of data into R, we recommend starting with the tidyverse packages listed below. They're certainly not perfect, but they are a good place to start. For rectangular data:

* **haven** reads SPSS, Stata, and SAS files.

* **readxl** reads excel files (both .xls and .xlsx).

* **DBI**, along with a database specific backend (e.g. RMySQL, RSQLite, RPostgreSQL etc) allows you to run SQL queries against a database and return a data frame.


## Subset R Objects

### Vectors
To Subset vectors we use the `[` operator.
```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a")  
x[1]    ## Extract the first element
```

```{r}
x[2]    ## Extract the second element
```
The `[` operator can be used to extract multiple elements of a vector by passing the operator an integer sequence. 
```{r}
x[1:4]
``` 
The sequence does not have to be in order; you can specify any arbitrary integer vector.
```{r}
x[c(1, 3, 4)]
```
We can also pass a logical sequence to the [ operator to extract elements of a vector that satisfy a given condition.


```{r}
x[x > "a"]
```

### Matrix

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x
```
```{r}
x[1, 2]
```
```{r}
x[1, ] # extract row 1
```
### List
```{r}
x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6, baz = "hello")
x
```
The `[[` operator can be used to extract single elements from a list. Here we extract the first element of the list.

```{r}
x[[1]]
```

```{r}
x[["bar"]] # extract element by named indices
```
```{r}
x$bar #  extract elements by name
```
```{r}
x[c(1, 3)] # extract the first and third elements of a list
```
### Data frame
```{r}
employee[,c(1,2,4)] # extract column 1, 2, and 4
```
```{r}
employee[employee$Education == "Bachelors",] # subset only the professionals with Bachelor degree 
```

### Removing NA Values

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 5)
x
```
```{r}
bad <- is.na(x)
bad
```
```{r}
x[!bad]
```


The dataset `airquality` is available in R
```
?airquality
```
```{r}
head(airquality,15)
```
```{r}
good <- complete.cases(airquality)
```
```{r}
head(airquality[good, ])
```
<span style="color:red">**Exercise 1:**</span> Extract from `employee` dataset the employees with `YearlyIncome` > 70000


## Work with Dates and Times

Times are represented by the `POSIXct` or the `POSIXlt` class
```{r}
date_ex <- c("1990-02-05")
class(date_ex)
```
```{r}
date_ex <- as.Date(date_ex)
class(date_ex)
```

You can extract pieces of dates and/or times.

* `weekdays`: give the day of the week
* `months`: give the month name
* `quarters`: give the quarter number ("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", or "Q4")

```{r}
weekdays(date_ex)
```
```{r}
months(date_ex)
```
```{r}
quarters(date_ex)
```

You can get Current Date and Time using the following functions.

```
Sys.time()
Sys.Date()
```
<span style="color:red">**Exercise 2:**</span> Extract weekday, month, quarter, and day of the week from today's date.

We can use mathematical operations on dates and times. We can do + and - and comparisons too (i.e. ==, <=)

```{r}
x <- as.Date("2018-03-04") 
y <- as.Date("2018-04-05") 

x+7 # Add 7 days to the date
```
```{r}
x-y
```
```{r}
x > y # logical statement
```

<span style="color:red">**Exercise 3:**</span> Extract the weekdays and months of the `HireDate` in the `employee` dataset.
